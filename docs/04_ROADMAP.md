# Project Roadmap

This document lists potential future features and major improvements for "Mio Trainer Personale". It serves as a high-level guide for the project's evolution. Items are not strictly prioritized unless specified.

## Proposed Features

### 1. Workout Templates
- **Concept:** Allow users to save a complete daily workout routine (exercises and rests) as a named template.
- **Benefit:** Users can quickly apply these templates to any day in the calendar, significantly speeding up the scheduling of recurring workouts.

### 2. Statistics & History Page
- **Concept:** A new dedicated view that provides insights into the user's workout history. This could be integrated into the calendar view.
- **Benefit:** Allows users to track their progress over time. Could include metrics like:
  - Total workouts completed.
  - Frequency of specific exercises.
  - Personal records (e.g., heaviest lift - future feature).
- **Functionality ideas:**
  - A button to clear all history.
  - A toggle to show history for the current week vs. all time.

### 3. Advanced Statistics
- **Concept:** A dedicated statistics page with more in-depth data visualization.
- **Benefit:** Allows users to track progress over time with charts and graphs for key exercises.
